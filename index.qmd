## Goals

My current goals are to obtain my PhD in Microbiology with a primary focus on wildlife conservation, ecology, and disease. My primary focuses are on genetic disease, impacts on the normal microbiome, and emerging diseases within various wildlife species. I hope to work with African wildlife once I have obtained my PhD.  

## Education

**Undergraduate**
I received my B.A. from Carroll College Helena MT in 2022. I double majored in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) as well as Biology.

**Graduate**
I am currently a Microbiology PhD Graduate Student at the University of New Hampshire. I am within the College of Life Sciences (COLSA) and Agriculture and the department of Molecular, Cellular, and Biomedical Sciences (MCBS). I am in my second year of the program. I am also a Graduate Student Teaching Assistant for General Microbiology. 

## Experience

**Undergraduate Research**

I worked on monitoring for West Nile Virus presence in mosquito pools across the state of MT. This included RNA extractions and qPCR. I also performed a comparative gene expression experiment to determine if the expression of a pigmentation gene differed across populations of mosquitoes in MT. 

**Molecular Diagnostics**

I worked as a molecular diagnostic laboratory technician for the MTVDL. I worked with various infectious agents of high agricultural impact such as High Pathogenic Avian Influenza. This involved high throughput extractions and qPCR as well as customer service with clients and delivering results in a timely manner. 

**Graduate Research**

I have many projects occuring as of now which can be found under my *Projects* tab.
